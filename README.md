### Waitlist Data Structure

  email: string,
  source: 'landing-page' | 'support-form-{type}',
  timestamp: ISO date string,
  createdAt: Unix timestamp,
  metadata?: {
    name?: string,
    subject?: string,
    message?: string,
    type?: string
  }
}
```

### Retrieving Waitlist Emails

To view all collected emails (for analytics/marketing):

```bash
curl https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-6c9b0e48/waitlist \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

Response:

}
```
